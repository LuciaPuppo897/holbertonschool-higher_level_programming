## Set
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on sets.

add()	Adds an element to the set
clear()	Removes all the elements from the set
copy()	Returns a copy of the set
difference()	Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets
difference_update()	Removes the items in this set that are also included in another, specified set
discard()	Remove the specified item
intersection()	Returns a set, that is the intersection of two or more sets
intersection_update()	Removes the items in this set that are not present in other, specified set(s)
