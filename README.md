## SQL Introduction
Basic introduction to SQL, covering fundamental concepts like creating tables, inserting data, and simple queries.

## SQL More Queries
Advanced SQL queries, including joins, subqueries, and more complex data retrieval methods.

## JavaScript DOM Manipulation
Projects involving JavaScript and DOM manipulation, demonstrating how to dynamically interact with HTML elements.

## Python Almost a Circle
Projects related to object-oriented programming in Python, with a focus on creating classes and methods, using a circle as a practical example.

## Python Classes
Exercises focusing on the creation and use of classes in Python, exploring object-oriented programming concepts.

## Python Data Structures
Projects exploring various data structures in Python, such as lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples, and their practical applications.

## Python Everything is Object
Understanding that everything in Python is an object, including concepts like object identity and mutable vs. immutable types.

## Python Exceptions
Handling exceptions in Python, learning how to use try, except, and finally blocks to manage errors and exceptions in code.

## Python Hello World
Introduction to Python programming, including basic syntax, variables, and simple input/output operations.

## Python If Else Loops Functions
Projects focusing on control flow in Python, including if statements, loops, and function definitions.

## Python Import Modules
