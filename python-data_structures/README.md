## List
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
Lists are created using square brackets:
## Diferences between l,ist and string
Lists are similar to strings, which are ordered collections of characters, except that the elements of a list can have any type and for any one list, the items can be of different types.
## Using list as stack and queue
- Stack works on the principle of “Last-in, first-out”. Also, the inbuilt functions in Python make the code short and simple. To add an item to the top of the list, i.e., to push an item, we use append() function and to pop out an element we use pop() function. These functions work quiet efficiently and fast in end operations.
- In case of stack, list implementation works fine and provides both append() and pop() in O(1) time. When we use deque implementation, we get same time complexity.
