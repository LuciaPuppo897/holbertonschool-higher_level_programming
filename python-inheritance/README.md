* What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
* What is a subclass
## Superclass, Base Class, Parent Class:

A superclass, base class, or parent class refers to a class that is extended or inherited from by another class. It serves as a template or blueprint for creating new classes, which are known as subclasses or derived classes.
In object-oriented programming (OOP), the superclass provides common attributes and methods that can be reused or overridden by the subclasses. Subclasses inherit the properties and behaviors of the superclass and can add their own specific attributes and methods.
Subclass:

## A subclass:
Also known as a derived class or child class, is a class that inherits properties (attributes and methods) from a superclass or parent class. It extends the functionality of the superclass by adding new attributes or methods or by modifying the behavior of inherited methods.
Subclasses can have their own unique attributes and methods in addition to those inherited from the superclass.
Listing Attributes and Methods of a Class or Instance:

## How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance

To list all attributes and methods of a class or instance in Python, you can use the dir()

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new lineThe first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc

### Python Test Cases
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder tests
All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
